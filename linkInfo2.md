 * This is some great music, and I hope that you’ll enjoy it as much as I have. Here’s the notes for this epoisode: Sirus Coven – The Sound of Color I met Sirus Coven on Garageband.com when doing a review for them on their song “The Sound of Color.” I love the intense trance sound they have, and with their incredible arrangements you cannot find a song of theirs that is boring. “The Sound of Color” is one of their songs on a sweet trance album “Cinematic” they just recently released, and the best thing is if you go to thier site now you can get the new album for free. free is a good word. Go to their site, and check this album. If you love Trance then you’ll love their album. Nick Taylor (Pleasure Dome) – Evil In the last episode you heard a song by Dr. Pete from Pleasure Dome, and this is another one from Nick Taylor of Pleasure Dome. They have a CD called “Satellite” which you can buy on their site. I met Dr. Pete on garageband.com, and set me his track and also this track too. Their music is sweet, and I’ve enjoyed everything I’ve heard. You can also enter into their sound lab, and listen, and then buy the music individually. They also have some tracks you can download for free from their albums. Every time I hear Evil it makes me think of Austin Powers. Eeeevvvvilll…. “I didn’t go to freaken Dr. evil school to be called mr.” Hellozero – Shine on me There isn’t a whole lot of electronic music on the podsafe music network, but when you find something its usally good. I hope that more people will submit their material to it, because I’ve found more music podcasters use this site very regularly. Hellozero is one of these artists that has some great music. He has a variety of music in different categories, but for his Dance music he really knows how to make some sweet stuff. I love this song, and it’s a great roll down the windows, and crank the volume song. check out more of his stuff at his site, or go to his site on the podsafe music network. JT – Wo es hin geht kann man springen You can see why I didn’t want to attempt to say the song name on the podcast…I’m not very bilingual, so I’m sorry JT if I didn’t get the song name in, but you’re music is great! Most of his music ranges from Dance, to electronic. Very cool, very nice, and very sweet. He too has some free music that you can download from his site, and it would worth having in your collection. Check out more of his music, and his demo stuff at his website, or you can check him out on the podsafe music network. Donkeyboy – Broke My Eyes I usually don’t play this soft of electronic music, but really it’s a great song. I met Donkeyboy on garageband.com, and they have had their music as track of the week. They have a lot of music on garagband.com, so check thier stuff out. I like the vocal in their music, and the smooth electronic feel. It’s the icing on the cake, and that’s why I wanted to play it, and have it as the last song. This is going to be in my make out music collectio..uhhhhh you didn’t read that. Thanks for tuning in! Have a great week!

They have another song that you can download off garageband.com that’s just as good. Here’s the link. It is worth having in your libary. SirJarl – Killing Heat I receved a lot of great e-mails about Jarl song “Spring Fever”, and thought that I would play more of his stuff on the show. “Killing Heat” is just a great song, and it just keeps me moving. He does this on the side as a hobbie, and I think he does a great job at it. I met Jarl on garageband.com, and he’s just a cool guy, so if you like any of his music e-mail him. Any information about him you can click on the name above, and it will send you to his site. Check his stuff out, and you can download all his music for free. Henta Ellis – Wanna luv you Another great artist from the podshow Podsafe music network. Her music reminds me of the Cranberries juiced up with a techno beat. Her other music is very mellow with a up tempo beat. I know I keep saying that I don’t play soft chill music, but…well…you’ve got to admit her music it pretty cool, so that justifies me playing it. You can listen to all of her music on here site which you can get to by clicking her name above. You can also visit her link to the podsafe music network by clicking here. Bass X – Reqium Very cool trance music. I met Bass-x from garageband.com while doing a review for this song. I love the sythns, and beat in this song it really stands out as some great trance music.

You can download this song and his others for free, and worth having in your collection also. Dynamite! – Hey Wait How could you not resist turning up that volume when you heard this song. Held 6th in the Dance Grene, and thier other song holds 2nd. I love the true dance feel in this song, and the vocalist is incredible. FiZiK (the producer) Wendy Jernigan (the vocalist) are just an outstanding duo. Go check them out on garageband.com, and download the music for yourself. Again IT’S ALL FREE!!!

What truly incredible is that you can get this album for free. Thanks guys for doing that for us! Check out more of the music on their website by clicking their name up top. Palebluedot – Mountain Road I’m a big fan of bagpipes, and when I heard this song I was estaic. I love the use of low constistan beat with a very mystical melody. All of this surrounded by bagpipes! Did I mechnion I like bagpipes? They currently have a site, but it’s not totally complete. To get thier account at garageband.com click here. This is some great music that I have put at the top of my list in my MP3 player. I hope you’ll enjoy this song, and drop them a line and let them know what you think about thier music. Bass X – Crystals Returing again with a brand spanken new song! Crystals is such an awesome song, and I want to thank Bass X in letting me feature it on the podcast. One thing I find in all of Bass X’s music is the very cool bass that he has. It’s like his signiture in all of his songs. Some bass tracks are sometimes too loud, or too quiet, but his are just dead on. With it’s very cool sythns that seem to be just complementing one another is like ear candy. Check out all of his music by clicking his name above. Project Oxid – Cycle Another great song from the garageband.com site. This is some great house trance that truly keeps your body moving. I love the high energy of this song along with the great mood layed out by the melody.

I hope you’ll enjoy this song. Palebluedot – Irus I wanted to play another song from Palebluedot, because I could decide which one to play on this podcast, so I came to a decsion to play both.

 * Welcome to Club Techtronic Sound. The podcast features a variety of Dance music. So get off you’re seat, and get on that dance floor for a great time. Voting still going on for the Best of Techtronic Sound (Thanks Bastiaan for you entry.) For more information click here. Here’s the line up: Mucho De Luxe – Hey Boy This is such a great Dance song. It always feels like it’s the weekend when I listen to that song. That could be a good thing, but it could be bad thing. I met Mucho De Lux on Garageband.com, and he has helped me go though the right loops in getting this song played. Thanks to him we have this great song for this podcast. I like the smooth guitars, and great beat. He has another song that you can find by clicking on his name above. If you liked this song then you’re going to love the other song he has. Rineau – Disco Outside Coming from the vault of 2003 this is an awesome song, and brings back the roots of dance to a more modern setting. Great stuff from Reneau. I never was born in the Disco era, but I can get enough of the stuff. I know that a lot of people don’t care for Disco which is cool, but I hope that you can enjoy this song. You cannot find yourself moving to the beat, and mesmerized by the crazy instruments in the song. They have some more great music, and I would encourage you to go check it out. Lounge Puppy – SUCKER I love this song. It’s smooth, with a great beat. It’s sort of a rest song in this podcast, but just enough beat to keep the heart going. This reminds me of chilling on a Sunday night. Lounge Puppy has a couple of really cool acid jazz/electronic that are worth checking out. This is one of his more upbeat songs, but he has such a great mood. I do wish it was a little longer, but it’s still a great song. They do have a couple more songs you can check out, and you can find more of their music by clicking here. Pleasure Dome – Lucky Ride Pleasure Dome is back with another great song. I love the hard deep beat that this song carries, and with its Arabic flair. I know I wouldn’t find this kind of music played in my state, but I know outside the U.S. it would be played. All of their songs are very different from each other, but similar feels. I’ve played a couple of their songs on previous podcasts which you can check out by scrolling down the screen. They have two CD’s out which you can preview, and download, or you can download just certain songs that you like. Freda – Dreaming of Tonite Returning again from episode 1 is this great artist. This is something I always hear at home. She always puts out some great music. You can check out more of her music at her website, and she does have a CD out which you can customize. Remember to VOTE!
