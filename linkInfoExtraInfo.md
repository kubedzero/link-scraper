  * This is some great music, and I hope that you’ll enjoy it as much as I have. Here’s the notes for this epoisode: Sirus Coven – The Sound of Color I met Sirus Coven on Garageband.com when doing a review for them on their song “The Sound of Color.” I love the intense trance sound they have, and with their incredible arrangements you cannot find a song of theirs that is boring. “The Sound of Color” is one of their songs on a sweet trance album “Cinematic” they just recently released, and the best thing is if you go to thier site now you can get the new album for free. free is a good word. Go to their site, and check this album. If you love Trance then you’ll love their album. Nick Taylor (Pleasure Dome) – Evil In the last episode you heard a song by Dr. Pete from Pleasure Dome, and this is another one from Nick Taylor of Pleasure Dome. They have a CD called “Satellite” which you can buy on their site. I met Dr. Pete on garageband.com, and set me his track and also this track too. Their music is sweet, and I’ve enjoyed everything I’ve heard. You can also enter into their sound lab, and listen, and then buy the music individually. They also have some tracks you can download for free from their albums. Every time I hear Evil it makes me think of Austin Powers. Eeeevvvvilll…. “I didn’t go to freaken Dr. evil school to be called mr.” Hellozero – Shine on me There isn’t a whole lot of electronic music on the podsafe music network, but when you find something its usally good. I hope that more people will submit their material to it, because I’ve found more music podcasters use this site very regularly. Hellozero is one of these artists that has some great music. He has a variety of music in different categories, but for his Dance music he really knows how to make some sweet stuff. I love this song, and it’s a great roll down the windows, and crank the volume song. check out more of his stuff at his site, or go to his site on the podsafe music network. JT – Wo es hin geht kann man springen You can see why I didn’t want to attempt to say the song name on the podcast…I’m not very bilingual, so I’m sorry JT if I didn’t get the song name in, but you’re music is great! Most of his music ranges from Dance, to electronic. Very cool, very nice, and very sweet. He too has some free music that you can download from his site, and it would worth having in your collection. Check out more of his music, and his demo stuff at his website, or you can check him out on the podsafe music network. Donkeyboy – Broke My Eyes I usually don’t play this soft of electronic music, but really it’s a great song. I met Donkeyboy on garageband.com, and they have had their music as track of the week. They have a lot of music on garagband.com, so check thier stuff out. I like the vocal in their music, and the smooth electronic feel. It’s the icing on the cake, and that’s why I wanted to play it, and have it as the last song. This is going to be in my make out music collectio..uhhhhh you didn’t read that. Thanks for tuning in!

  * Welcome to Club Techtronic Sound. The podcast features a variety of Dance music. So get off you’re seat, and get on that dance floor for a great time. Voting still going on for the Best of Techtronic Sound (Thanks Bastiaan for you entry.) For more information click here. Here’s the line up: Mucho De Luxe – Hey Boy This is such a great Dance song. It always feels like it’s the weekend when I listen to that song. That could be a good thing, but it could be bad thing. I met Mucho De Lux on Garageband.com, and he has helped me go though the right loops in getting this song played. Thanks to him we have this great song for this podcast. I like the smooth guitars, and great beat. He has another song that you can find by clicking on his name above. If you liked this song then you’re going to love the other song he has. Rineau – Disco Outside Coming from the vault of 2003 this is an awesome song, and brings back the roots of dance to a more modern setting. Great stuff from Reneau. I never was born in the Disco era, but I can get enough of the stuff. I know that a lot of people don’t care for Disco which is cool, but I hope that you can enjoy this song. You cannot find yourself moving to the beat, and mesmerized by the crazy instruments in the song. They have some more great music, and I would encourage you to go check it out. Lounge Puppy – SUCKER I love this song. It’s smooth, with a great beat. It’s sort of a rest song in this podcast, but just enough beat to keep the heart going. This reminds me of chilling on a Sunday night. Lounge Puppy has a couple of really cool acid jazz/electronic that are worth checking out. This is one of his more upbeat songs, but he has such a great mood. I do wish it was a little longer, but it’s still a great song. They do have a couple more songs you can check out, and you can find more of their music by clicking here. Pleasure Dome – Lucky Ride Pleasure Dome is back with another great song. I love the hard deep beat that this song carries, and with its Arabic flair. I know I wouldn’t find this kind of music played in my state, but I know outside the U.S. it would be played. All of their songs are very different from each other, but similar feels. I’ve played a couple of their songs on previous podcasts which you can check out by scrolling down the screen. They have two CD’s out which you can preview, and download, or you can download just certain songs that you like. Freda – Dreaming of Tonite Returning again from episode 1 is this great artist. This is something I always hear at home. She always puts out some great music. You can check out more of her music at her website, and she does have a CD out which you can customize.

  * Jethro – Challange for Sark, and ID
  * What action pack duo. I met Jethro after listing to his music on Afterhourdjs.com when he was doing a live session. Just incredible music. I’ve waited till the day I could play his stuff to people, and that day finally came. Challenge for Sark reminds me of the old days of sitting in front of the TV, and playing on the 2600 Atari. ID really has such a great feel, and a great beat. I love how it takes this theme of technology from the previous song, and creates it’s own identity. Check out Jethro’s site, and you can download, and listen to most of his stuff that he’s featured on Afterhourdjs.com.
  * Jay Sustain – Johnson & Sustain – Perpetual Excursion
  * I met jay on the isound network through Bass-X, and he’s got some great stuff. A lot of the music played on this podcast had a very consistent beat that just glided along the whole time. Jay does a fantastic job in continuing this awesome feel, with mind entertaining melodies. He has some more music which you can check out by selecting his name, and they are worth checking them out. I know he has his music out to download, and I would say that this would be an artists to add to you’re list.
  * Edito – Melody
  * This is a great chill ending. It’s very diffrent than what I play usally on Techtronic Sound, but I wanted to see what you think. I also met Edito on the music.download.com, they currently only have one song out, but it’s a great chill-out trance song. The meoldy is very strange in the the begining, but then it just seems to match well with the rest of the melodies, and beat. This is truly one crazy song that it’s addictive.
* 08-techtronic-sound
  * I’ve got a great show for you. Make sure you vote, because every vote counts. Any Questions click here. Here’s the artists for this show:
  * Tranceparency – Origin
  * I just want to say thanks to Tranceparency for letting me play this great song. I really like the way it plays with the midevil chants in the beginning, and then builds up to this great trance beat. I thought that this would be a great start to a awesome podcast. You can check out more of his music at his garageband.com site by clicking his name above. Thy have more music that are just as good as this.
  * James Wolujewicz – Discovery
  * Sorry again James, but I tried to say your last name, but I feel bad every time I have to pronounce a name, and then screw it up. It’s just like JT’s song a couple of podcasts ago. What a beat, and what a melody. This song carries a great mood the whole time. Very cool. A lot of his other music is this smooth trace feel, so if this is something that you like then it’s worth you time to check out more of his music. You can download more of his music, and hope that you will spend time, and e-mail him, and tell him what you think about his music.
  * DJ Spread – Fiume
  * I was going to play this song a while back, but after putting it with the other songs it just didn’t fit, and I wanted to make sure I was going to give this great song it’s full credit, and I think it fits perfectly with this show. Thanks DJ Spread for sending the music to me. This is such a cool melody, and mood. This has a little more club action in it, but it also has a great trance/techno feel to it. More of his music can be found above, and all worth a listen to. His music isn’t ready for download, but I would bug him to get a CD out, or at least some of his music out for you’re downloading pleasure.
  * Dynamite! – Slowburn
  * If I could give an award out for an awesome singer, and a great DJ it would be for Dynamite! They have such a ruff, dark, and rich sound that I can’t get enough of. They recorded the vocals quite some time ago, but recently they remixed the melody, and this is thier result. An awesome that it’s so addicting. If you like this music, and you’re fairly new to Techtronic Sound I would check out thier other song “Hey Wait” on one of out previous podcast. That’s another one that you can download free from thier site, and it’s just as addicting as this song. Thanks guys for putting out this awesome stuff, and I can’t wait to hear something new.
  * Gavinizer – Misinterpreted
  * Daft Punk was my first techno artist that I was introduced to, and still is one of my favorites. This song brings a lot of memories when I first heard their “Homework” album. Gavinizer has such a great beat, and melody. I love the way the mood of the song, and the unforgettable beat. It kinda makes you want to do the robot…ok that just made me feel really old. You can check out more of their stuff, and download more of their music by clicking thier name up above.

  * What a song. Thanks again 303infinity for letting us enjoy that great song.

I’m not sure when they would be putting out a CD, but if you like this, and all the other music you can sample through the other site then e-mail them, and let them know that you love their music, and would buy it if they have it out.

* 12-techtronic-sound
  * You’ve probley noticed that the title format is diffrent, and that’s so those who use mp3 players can see what episode they are picking. This is another great Dance Episode. I’ve played a lot of trance, and techno music latley, and thought we should have another show dedicated to Dance music. Thanks for tuning in to your Independent Radio. Enjoy!
  * DJ Colette – Feelin Hypnotized
  * Smooth, good beats, and just plain awesome. Dj Colette has such an awesome voice, and I’m so glad to play this song. I can’t get enough of this song. She’s sung for Kaskade who is also another artist who’s featured in this episode, and this is her own track under her name. You can download this song from the link above, and you can’t say that you don’t like this song. You really feel hypnotized listening to this song. She only has a vinyl out currently of this, and other songs which you can find by clicking here.
  * Kaskade – I Like the Way
  * Another great song by the duo group. This is very clean dance music that you can’t resist moving to. Colette is the vocals for this song, and I think it’s another fantasic song she does. You can download this song from the link above, and you can get his CD by clicking here. I love this song. It really makes me want to get up a move (ok that’s probley a scarry thought for you.) This is truly should be another song added to your list, and you can get this song for free!
  * Wideband Network – Show Me Love
  * An awesome techno/dance song that has so much to offer for your ears. You can download this song from the link above, and they also have another song called “The Silence” which you can find by going to his garageband.com site by clicking here. He also has a CD out that you can get which is great. Basically if you like this song then getting the album is twice the greatness. You can also check out more of his stuff by clicking that link above. Check it out. I know you’ll like it.
  * LOVECHILD – You’re the One
  * Yes you’ve heard this before, but it was used as background music for The Best of Techtronic Sound. It’s a cool beat that really keeps the body moving with some fun vocals. They have been featured on garageband.com network in the top ranking of house artists. They do have a couple of others that are good too, and the best thing about it is you can download it to your music libary for free! That’s a great word isn’t it!
  * Comfortable – Walk on the Wild Street
  * A great group from Japan that it’s sole purpose is to bring comfort. So I hope that you feel comfortable when you listen to this song. I did. They have some song listed at the link above, but you can check out more of his music by going to this link. This is another great Techno/Dance song that has some great Daft Punk beats (Did I ever say that I liked Daft Punk? However I’m still effy on thier last CD, but it’s still good.)

* 13-techtronic-sound
  * Another awesome show to get you through the week. Thanks Adama for the awesome intro to the show. Here’s all the goodies on the artists:
  * Adama – Show me the exit
  * Adama has such a great voice that matches well with her great track. It has such flavor that you find yourself listening to again, and again. Great stuff. Now the link above will send you to her site, but like always, thiers more. You can check out her Myspace account at www.myspace.com.adama.

It’s like theirs eating food as is, and then theirs eating food with a little spice. That spice is Adama. Hope you’ll check out more of her stuff.
  * Oxid Project – Utopial Sounds
  * I know I screwed up on the name on the podcast. For some reason I got it fixed in my head that it was the other way. Regardless on how the name got pernouced it’s still an awesome track. This is his first song that he put out on the web, and it’s just great. I like the suspensful feel, having you wonder what in the world is the song going to go. Then it just takes you their without you knowing. He is worth being played again. You can also download this track as well as the other that has been played at garageband.com.
  * Soundhole – Welcome to the world of Sound
  * This is such a mystious track. It’s cool. I like the beat throughout the song, and the mood that it carries. I added this in as a way to bring you down for a little bit during the podcast, because thier was something greater coming along the way. I like the diffrent themes, and moods that it creates. You have ont theme that carries you to a point while another sits and waits for your arival to take you down another path. It truly is a wonderful world of sound. You can find more of this stuff at the link above, and all the rest of his music is worth having in your collection.
  * Jay Sustain – Now Bording
  * Another fantastic song by jay sustain. This is another song that has a lot of intresting themes that carries you through the world of sound. It has such a great feeling, and consistant beat. This song is very great because it had moments were it changes movements in a mater of seconds with sounds that all match. Way cool mix. This is one you can check out at his site, and let him know what you think about his music by e-mailing him. If you like this track, and you want to download it, you have a good chance in asking him if you can have a copy, or where you can find a copy of his track.
  * DJ Nirwana – Amsterdam
  * I actually had a track all layed out for this spot, but it just didn’t fit in the mix. It wasn’t until saturday night that I got an e-mail from DJ Nirwana with this track. What a cool trance/dance track. It just make you feel so happy when you listen to it. You can get your own copy from the above link, and it’s truly worth having.
* 14-techtronic-sound

  * Jethro – Rumpfunk
  * Yes he’s back with some more great music. I don’t know if you’ve downloaded any of his mixes, but they are great. I love this song because it has such a great beat to you. I don’t know if I can’t stop bobbing my head when listing to this song. You can find this song under the mixset called”Ascension.Annapurna.” This is a great set, and worth having in your collection. I first heard Jethro on Afterhoursdjs.com, and I can’t get enough of his music.
  * Wideband Network – The Silence
  * Very cool song. I know I played another song of his before, but this has a really cool bass, melody, and vocals. Very cool. The really great about this song is how it’s setup one way, but then at the end it just throws you a loop, and gives you something else. I just love how that’s is. He has a CD out, which you can check out by going to his link above. You can listen to some of the music he has on his CD, and all of it is awesome. Love this stuff, and I’m sure that you would love it too. I found his stuff on garageband.com, and I know I put that link below on show #12.
  * 303 Infinity – True Love Never Fades
  * 303 Inifinity music is awesome. The start if this song is great. That beat is awesome, and love how it just brings in all the songs elements in very inconspicuously. So far I havn’t heard about their CD yet, and if it’s coming out soon, but you can preview a lot of their music right now at the link above. I know that I had another link to their stuff, on show #11, but I’ve found another. They have a Myspace account, so you can get more information about their music. Very cool group, and another worth checking out.
  * Messier 87 – Odessa 2003
  * Very cool track that I can’t get enough of. I through me off after I put this song together because you go from such a mellow beat to a fast trance beat, and I questioned if that transition really worked, but after listening to it a couple times it sounded cool. It really sets you up right off the bat, and has such a great mood to it. I met Messier 87 at dance-industries.com which is a very cool site that has some great music to fill all the electronic music voids in your life.
  * Radio Cero – Come & Go
  * I can’t enough of this music. I wish they had more music out, because it’s so great. The beat, and high hat are a great start then you hear, what I call, the underwater feel it left we wondering what was to come. Then the song just shifts, and takes off. Very cool stuff. I’m a big sucker for piano’s, but it really takes you though such a awesome melody. The beat is great an just keeps you just moving though the song. I know that you can get this song for free off garageband.com, and it’s another song worth having in your collection.
  * Jethro – It’s you, It’s me
  * This is a great song to finish off with. This is another song off the mix that Rumpfunk is on. It’s kinda like a waving good bye to an awesome voyage through sound.
* 15-techtronic-sound
  * Holy CRAP! 1,000 Subscribers! Woo hoo. Here’s the notes for the show:
  * DJ Spread – Vortex Syth Mix
  * I had a lineup all ready to go before recording Saturday, but I had a void that I couldn’t seem to fill. Low, and Behold I got an e-mail from DJ Spread, and after a couple of e-mails back and forth he sent this awesome song. It really starts of the show, and I love it. The rolling bass line keeps your ears moving, and the sythns complement the mix so much. I’ve always been intrigued by DJ spreads mixes, and really can’t get enough of them. I added his myspace link to his name above. If you like his music, feel free to e-mail him, and let him know what you think about his stuff. Thanks again DJ Spread for the great opportunity.
  * DJ Nirwana – Taking Off
  * Does the beat feel ever stop on this show? This is another great song by DJ Nirwana. I played his song “Amsterdam” a couple of podcast ago, and I try not to play an artist that I’ve played before too close with the last time I’ve played them, but I couldn’t help myself. Sorry. I hope it’s not that horrible of me to do that to you guys. It just means that he’s extra important to have in your music library. Very cool mix, and very cool beat. This really has such a great movement to it, and trance feel. You can get this and the other song free at his garageband.com site. Go check it out!
  * Pleasure Dome – Good Thing
  * This song is a good thing. Yah, I forgot I had this song. Dr. Pete of Pleasure Dome sent this, and the three other mix quite sometime ago, and I thought that I was out of their material to play until the other day I was listening to my iPod and this song came up. I thought what the crap? Who’s this? Well long story short, I loved this song that I wanted to share it with you guys. It has such a great feel, and just a great beat. It’s updated groove song. That would be a great band name…The Updated Groove….no..nevermind. Thanks Dr. Pete and Pleasure Dome for all the fun adventures in sound that they have brought to the show. They have a CD with this, and the other played at their site.
  * Arkode – Urban Angel
  * This is a great Deep House cut, and very great vocals. This is a very cool, smooth feel. I found it interesting to put this into the mix. We started out with trance, then house, and then Deep house, but this was such a perfect spot for this song to be. I love the vocals so much. It’s so mysterious, but inviting all at the same time…Mysterious, but Inviting…band name? No. I really should stop that. I would love to do a show that has all deep house music. This is chill music to me, but it’s not going to put me asleep. You can download this track from their site.
  * ThirdBeat – Skydive
  * A Great song to end with. Love it. It has some great piano, and syths that I can get enough of. It has a great buildup to the main section of the song. The beat that this song carries is great because you really don’t notice it a whole lot, but it’s their backing up the song the whole time. Love it. Thanks again ThirdBeat for letting us listen to this great song. Check out his site. He has another song that you can check out that’s great.
* 16-techtronic-sound
  * IT’S HERE!!!! Sorry about the delay, but last weeks problems just screwed me up. What a show. Hope you’ll enjoy all the music. Remember to add your zip code to theTechtronic Sound Map! For those who have a Myspace account you can link up with this site atwww.myspace.com/techtronicsound. Here are the notes for the show:
  * DJ Mozy – Land of Dreams
  * This song just mezmorizes my ears everytime I hear it. Love it! This is some great Trance, and DJ Mozy has a lot of this great music. The rolling bass, and random sequence really makes this song sing. I wish I could set this song to my Alarm Clock in the morning, and wake up to this instead of the regular boring alarm. Another great artist from the garageband.com network. What an awesome site, with awesome artists like DJ Mozy!
  * Memories of Tomorrow – Trance of Life (neocate remix)
  * Trance, you want trance, what can I say, I gave you trance. This is a fantasitc song, and I love it. It has moving beat, great mood, and what about the vocalist. Can we say SWEEET!!! The whole song it just perfect, and I’m so glad the Memories of Tomorrow has allowed us to hear the beauty. WE WANT TO HEAR MORE!!! He currently has just this one song out, but the greatest thing is you can click on his name above, and it will send you to his site, so you can have this song for your very own.
  * DJ Tek-NeiN – Einmyria
  * This is a great hard beat with great sythns, and tracks to that makes this song great. I love how this song keeps you wondering what this song is going to sound like, and then it starts to unfold while taking your ears through a journey of sound. DJ Tek-Nein did a great job with this song, and you can check out more of his material at his myspace site which you by clicking his name above, and enjoying all his great music that he has to offer. Thanks again DJ Tek-Nein for the track!
  * Hypnotik – Telex
  * Hypnotik puts you in such a deep trance with this song. Not a sleep trance, but a memorizing trance thats just awesome. The mood is great, and the beat is perfect for this song. This song fits so perfectly in the mix, but is a little diffrent from the rest of the songs. I’ve started a liking for the really deep songs. It’s music to the ears, it’s bass for the soul, it’s a work of art, it’s truly incredible, it’s all inside….it’s all inside? haha that’s from a commercial. A lot of their music is just as great as this one which you can check out my going to the link above.
  * DJ Sted-E – Blinded by the Light
  * Fantasic!!!!! When I heard this song for the first time I couldn’t get enough of this song. DJ Sted-E knows how to light up the dance floor. Everytime I hear this song it makes me feel like it’s frday, and in slow motion, I’m running out of work cheering with my arms up in the air…and then when the songs over I realize that it’s only monday..CRAP. One exciting thing is I’m going got have DJ Sted-E on the show at the end of the month, so stay tuned for some great tunes. Thanks again DJ Sted-E for a great track, and for letting me play it for everyone.
  * LOVECHILD – Party All Night
  * What a song. It’s like mixing the minds of Daft Punk, and Deep Dish, and out comes this song. Fantasic! I’ve played their song a couple songs back, and well I thought that this would be a great closer to a sweet cast. Plus I know this song will get stuck in your head for the rest of the day. Enjoy, and have a sweet week. Check out more of LOVECHILD’s music out up at the link above. Have a great week!

  * Alien Six – You’ve Got The City
  * What great song to start out this podcast with. It has such a moving beat, and exciting mood. If you’re not moving a foot, head, or something then you must be dead, because it’s hard not to move when you listen to this. Alien six is an awesome group, and all their music ranges from House, Dance, Techno, and Trance. I found this group thru garageband.com, and stumbled upon their CD. It is great!!!! Worth the download, and it only costs around $10. Treat yourself to some great music. Now I found they had the CD on iTunes, and the link.They have so many styles of music which makes their CD rock. I love this song “You’ve Got the City”, and their other song “Disc From.” Awesome group!
  * TerraNation – It’s a Dream
  * TerraNation, DJ $iloO ET directed me to this awesome song, and after contacting, and begging…well ok there was no begging involved, we can have the opportunity to hear this song. Thanks so much for the referral DJ $iloO ET!!!! This is a sweet trance song, and I can’t get enough of it. It reminds me a lot of 4 strings, but even better. The mood, feel, everything about this song is just great. TerraNation has more music that’s just as good, and which you can get to by clicking the link above.
  * Juicy Music – Bang to the Beat
  * I love this song, because it just has a heavy beat that I can’t get enough of. It’s loud, something worth enjoying a little head banging to. I was told my Dance was a little soft, so when I found Juicy Music I exited to see if I can get it on the show. The beat, sythns, and vocal tracks are just perfect. Now everyone get up out of your chair, couch, seat, whatever you’re sitting on a start dancing!!! Thanks so much Juicy Music for letting us listen to this sweet song, and I hope that we can venture with some more music of yours in the future.
  * Infinite Dimensions – Percuilar Planet
  * It’s actually Percuilar Planet. I got the first part right, but I missed the planet. Dave from Infinite Dimensions is smoking up the speakers with this psychedelic Goa trance. Very cool, and I really enjoy the mood and feel of the whole song. They should be playing this song when you’re on that Disneyland ride, Space Mountain. That would be cool. It has such a majestic feel that captivates your ears, and takes your an a great trance journey. Infinite Dimensions had a couple of more songs up, but it seems that were taken down, so I will keep you posted when more music comes in the future.
  * Beatlevel – Dark Soul
  * This song is all about the beat, so if you have a sub, then you must…TURN IT UP!!! A sweet myspace group that it all about dishing up the beat. This song is great, because of the way they mash up their insane beats with their sythns, and tracks. It gets better, and better as the song goes on. Thanks Beatlevel for this awesome song. Now they also have more music that you can check out at their myspace.com site which you can get to from the link above.
  * Have a great week!!!!

  * Generation of Trance – Voices of Winter
  * Generation of Trance has some of the best mixes I’ve heard. This song is from one of their mixes, and it’s just amazing. It has such a cool smoother feel to it that I enjoy. The link above will send you to their main site, but here is theirMyspace account where you can find more goodies to listen to. This is such an excellent group, and worth having more in my music collection. They’re going to do some stuff here soon that’s going to be really cool, so I will keep you posted thru the newsletter.
  * Neocate – Energize
  * This song lives up to its name. Energize really gets your heart pumping, and body moving. I found Neocate on Ctgmusic.com, and just feel in love with all his music. Neocate does another sweet job with this song, and I’m glad I’m able to play another one from him again. It has such a cool synth melody that just makes this song sing, and the beat is perfect for this song. Thanks again Neocate for the opportunity to play this great song. You can download both this, and his other songs for free by going to this link above.
  * Romantech – Moving On
  * This a little different than I usually play, but Dave sent me an E-Mail and wanted to hear some Drum and Bass music. I did some searching, and found this sweet artist. Romantech ranges from this fast beat with the smooth melody, to a mellow music. You can check out more of his stuff at the link above, but he also has a Myspace account which you can access by clicking on this link. Let me know what you think about this style, and if you would like to hear more of it. I really enjoy this style, but sometimes I don’t want to stray too far away from the Trance, Dance, and Techno styles.
  * Damiele – Happy Feelings
  * This is just a great trance song that really just makes you happy (Even when I’m just about dead from the Holidays.) The beat gets you moving, and the melody is just perfect. Damiele’s music is just amazing. The mood that he creates with this song is just unbelievable, and mix of all his tracks meld perfectly with each other. Love it, Love it, LOVE IT! This and the rest of his music can be found by going to the link above, and like always the best part about it is that you can download all of his music for free.
  * Divider – Entropy
  * This show started off fast and hard, and I wanted to end this song with a great smooth trance song. Divider has just a great beat, and tone that was perfect for then ending of this mix. It has all the right touches in this song. From the bass beat, to the crazy sythns, to the production of this song it truly has the make of a great song. Divider has more music like this which you can check out also from the link above, and you can snag this number for free too at the link above. Thanks again Divider for the awesome song.
* 19-techtronic-sound
  * Happy 2006! Hope everyone is doing well. Here are the show notes for the episode:
  * K-Boox – Everybody Like you
  * What a fun song! I’m so gald that k-boox allowed us to play this song. I enjoy the fun vocals that he has put into this song, and the hard beats that back it up. It really gets the body moving right of the bat, and keeps that feel through the rest of the song. I found that when I first listened to this song I didn’t think it was going to take the course that it does. It starts with one segment, and builds into somthing else. When the two segments come togeather this song just sings. I hope that K-Boox brings out some more of this great music. Download this one! It’s FREE!!!!! Thanks again K-Boox
  * Minomus – Northern Lights (Extended Mix)
  * Well due to recent event’s I’m going to have to remove Minomus’s sweet song “Northern Lights (Extened Mix)” from the show, and hopefully eather replace it with another of his songs, or something else. He has been contacted to get that song signed. This is an great opertunity for Munomus, but it sucks that it knocks this awesome song off because of legel issues. 🙁
  * Minomus – Sun Frezzer
  * After a couple of tries I’ve finally found replacement. I hate to say replacement, but it had to be done. Another great song by Minomus, and I’m glad that we could at least still feature this great artist. His music is getting signed like hot cakes. It’s a bummer, but also an incentive to grab his music while it’s free before it takes off. This is a little softer that the song before, but it’s just as good. Their is something about minomus style that is so intriguing to the ear. The beats are perfect, and the melody sings, what more can I say other than this artist rocks!! You can grab most of his music at the link above, and like I said before if you like his stuff make sure you grab it before it goes away.
  * Solid Xciter – Side by Side
  * Another incredible song, and well worth the download. I met Xciter at CTG Music, and just a really cool artist. He currently has just this song out right now, but you can download it for FREE at the link above. This song might be signed up like minomus’s music, so grab it while you can. Xciter also has a myspace account by CLICKING HERE, so you can sign up to be his friend, and in hopes to inspire him to make some more noise out in the electronic world. Thanks so much Xciter the letting us play your stuff….now make some more!! 🙂
  * Profesor Sketchy – Freeter
  * Cool song! It seams in the last two podcast that I’ve started the show up high, and then brought the feel down….it’s like a work out. I should make a work out mix, yah, add it to the 5 million things that are going on in my life! HAH! But it would be cool. Maybe it would help me go excersie. HAH! The beat is great on this song, and how he incorperates the melody, and hits along with it. He comes from the garageband.com network, and just a fatasic artist. You can get this song also for free (Wow, wouldn’t it be nice if the whole world was like this), and his other music. Hope you’ll enjoy this song as much as I have.
  * Sector7Seven – Light is Brighter Than Life
  * Awesome! awesome, awesome, AWESOME!!! Love the voice in this song, and the whole production of it. This is actually a couple of years old, but when I stubled upon it I couldn’t let it not be heard. Just a fantastic song, and worth having in your collection. This is another CTG Music artist that has gone beyond the norm, and has put togeather such a great song. I really can’t get enough of it. Just great!
* 20-techtronic-sound
  * Number 20!!!!! Woo hoo! Here is all the information from adding comments to iTunes, to adding a pin on the map:
  * Add yourself to the Techtronic Sound Map
  * Add a comment on to the Techtronic Sound iTunes page.
  * Here are the show notes:
  * SubAudeo – Lies Beneath
  * Can I say any more than Awesome, and Incredible! It gave me goose bumps the first time I heard this whole song. I love the vocals that are in this song. It really reminds me of a 4 Strings song. It has such a sweet feel through the song that just calms you down, and keeps you moving. It’s not too much, and it’s not too little, it’s just right. You can find more of SubAudeo’s stuff at the link above, and their other songs are worth checking out. They don’t have this song to download, so bug them to put out a CD with this song so we could all enjoy it. Thanks again for the sweet track SubAudeo.
  * Trance Formers – Never saw her again
  * This song has a great, hard beat with some great tracks to back it up. I love the feel of this song. It starts to move you at the beginning, and then it starts to take off. This is another great CTG Music artist. There are a lot of them on the site, and I’m glad that CTG Music, and the artists have put together such a great source of music to help our addiction to electronic music. You can download this song for free, and others that Trance Formers has put out.
  * Elephantronic – Angel Leia
  * This is such a rich song with such a cool trance feel. It’s what you get then you mix some crazy techno beat with some awesome trance tracks. I found Elephantronic on myspace.com, which is a great place to find some sweet artists. Man, Myspace.com, just like others is a gold mine of great artists. I always wonder why some of these great artists don’t have labels, or record deals when they sound so good. Elephantronic have some more of this awesome music, all available for download.
  * Chris Micali – DITF
  * I got an e-mail from an listener wanting to hear some of Chris’s music. I e-mailed Chris, and asked if we could play his music. A month later I got an e-mail saying that it’s cool, so I’m happy to present such a sweet song by Chris Micali. It’s hard wondering if some artists are going to let you play their music, but when I saw that I got an e-mail back from chris I was so excited. It really has such cool hard beat with a great melody. Chris has a couple of more songs that you can pick up for free from his link above. Thanks again Chris.
  * Alien Six – Disc Form
  * Alien Six returns with another great song from their Establishing Alpha CD. If you haven’t picked up a copy of it yet, then you’re really missing out on some great music. Here is the iTunes link to get to their album: Alien Six – Establishing Alpha. It has such a cool tribal beat to it that I can’t get enough of. The melody is just perfect for the song, and really carries the whole song so well. Excellent stuff and I can’t wait to hear more from Alien Six in the Future. Thanks again guys for letting us here your awesome work.
  * Something Completely Diffrent – Heman vs. the 4 non blonds
  * Enjoy this great work of art.
* 21-techtronic-sound
  * Techtronic Sound’s Concert Series – DJ Sted-E
  * I was so psyched to know that DJ Sted-E was going to let us hear one of his mixes. We had him on the show a couple of episodes ago with his fantastic song “Blinded by the light.” Now we get to feature some of his new stuff. Some of the music you might be familiar with, and some you might not be. This set is all house music that is sweet. Many thanks DJ Sted-E for the sweet mix. I’ll have some more information, and links for DJ Sted-E in the days to come, so keep an eye on the show notes for updates. Here is the playlist for the session. Enjoy!
* 22-techtronic-sound
  * It’s the end of January, and into the month of Love, and Birthdays. I’m turning the ripe old age of 26 on the 8th right when I just got used to being 25. Many thanks to DJ Sted-E for the mix last week, and next month we’ve got Koroma with an incredible Trance mix! Here are the show notes for this episode:
  * Neocate – Let Me Love You (Debuzz)
  * What a remix from Neocate. I got an e-mail from him a couple of weeks ago, and I was so excited about it when I heard it. Fantastic stuff. I actually was going to hold it for a later episode, but sometime when I get great music like that I can’t just hold it. I just NEED to play it. I’ve played some of Neocates music a couple times before, so if this is the first time you have heard his music then I check out his other stuff, because it’s just as good as this. Thanks Neocate for the song!
  * Indigo Dreamer – Break You Open
  * Thanks again to Indigo Dreamer for letting us listen to this great song. The vocals, arrangement, and production of this song are incredible. Sometimes I find music through searching through different sites to find the music, and then e-mail the artist if I can play this song. Sometimes I don’t hear back, or I get a negative on playing it. When I heard this song I was hoping that I could play it, and when I got the e-mail saying it was cool I was do happy. Go to Indigo Dreamers site, and check out the rest of his music, it’s great!
  * Kondencuotas Pienas – Nevertheless
  * Why in the world am I playing more Drum & Bass music when I’m all about just the Techno, Trance, and Dance music? It’s a good song. Actually I got my brain thinking again, and thought it would be cool to do a show on the side that is exclusively through the newsletter, and it’s all about the Ambient Drum & Bass, and Ambient Trance music. So if this is your cup of Tea then e-mail me at techtronicsound@gmail.com and ask for the newsletter. This is a great song, and I would say it’s a rest song from all the incredible music a ready played, and the incredible music to come. Check out the rest of Kondecuotas Pienas’s music.
  * Terranation Remix- Ian Van Dahl -Castle In Sky
  * Another great song from Terranation. I enjoy their music a lot, and the vocals that they have in this song. It seems that I was on a vocal thing on this episode, but they are some great songs. It’s such a fast passed song, but that it’s a nice smooth song at the same time, and I find that’s what makes this song so great. If you have heard his music either then check it out in episode 17, and listen to his music online. All of his downloads are free!!! It’s like stepping in to the room all made out of candy in that Willy Wonka movie.
  * F Fact – Walk on Water
  * In the top charts in the Trance Genre at Garageband.com we find this great artist, F Fact. Some incredible trance music that I enjoy. I really like the style of Walk on Water, and the production of it too. It’s mystical, intriguing, and mind numbing. Usually some artists have a certain style that they do, but I’ve found the F Fact has more than just one, or two styles in his songs. Every time I hear a different song of his it’s a different feel, and approach to his music. Thanks for the song F Fact, and check out more of his stuff at the link above.
  * SCD: Reknology – GLYCEROL
  * This is some crazy Techno music, but I want to know what you guys think about it. Leave your comments below about the song. I got an e-mail from Reknology a couple months ago, but this song has just been released. You can check out this song and others at the link above.
* 23-techtronic-sound
  * Techtronic Sound’s Concert Series – Koroma
  * Another great show coming at you this week. I’ve been excited for quite sometime to play this artist, and now the time has come to hear his incredible music. This is some fantastic Trance music that will make your week. The selection of music is great, and beat is great, and the whole production of the mix is great. Many thanks to Koroma for working with me in getting his music on. Here’s the playlist for the episode, enjoy:
* 24-techtronic-sound
